      "And, I think that what really really bugs me is, I keep circling back to that time, wondering, if I'd seen her death, how would it have been to know, in that moment, that this was how she was going to leave? That we wouldn't do the rest of life together? That all our plans wouldn't be lived out?",
      "All those times when I'd speak on my friendship with Comfort and talk about how she was literally my `day 2` in uni. The second friend I made. How could I have, in those moments, thinking about how we met, ever imagined that this is how she'd leave?",
      "And it feels so surreal to think about it now, my sweet, sweet, kind to a fault, strong girl. It's so hard because there are hardly any major memories where you're not in it with me. I'd never imagined I'd be here and you'd be gone? Gosh. There are hardly any memories where you're not there. Oh God. ",

But, it's in these kinds of moments that you realize that every little kindness really pays because, there's no one that knew her, & heard this news, that didn't talk about how kind she was. And that's really just wholesome. ",
      "Comfort would walk into a room and it would light up. That was just how she was. She had the largest smile ever. She laughed with all of her face. She really really was such a cheery person. If you needed help, she'd be there. No matter how tired she was. Comfort would find a middle ground for you. My God. Comfort would show up for you! Comfort would help you when everyone else would be too lazy or groggy to do something, Comfort would be the one to do it for you. God. ",

She'd still find a way to make a joke out of the situations. She, gosh, she was such a strong girl. All that pain but she'd be there. She would smile. She would laugh. She would show up still. She really was such an Angel. She was the sweetest person, fr. She was so so kind. She was so so smart. She was such a beautiful human. I really miss her. I really miss her. Gosh. My sweet girl.",
