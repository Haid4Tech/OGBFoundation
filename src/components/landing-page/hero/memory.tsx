              gbenyi Mary-Comfort Anastasia Agi was a beloved daughter, sister,
              and friend. Born on the 11th of June, 2000, in Abuja, Nigeria, she
              grew up to become a beacon of kindness, joy, immeasurable
              strength, and compassion.{" "}

            Her kindness, love, and resilience touched everyone she met. Her
            unwavering commitment to helping others, her selflessness, and her
            infectious smile left an indelible mark on her family, friends, and
            community. She passed away on the 28th of March, 2023, after a
            three-year battle with a rare form of cancer stemming from
            hereditary neurofibromatosis (NF1). Although her journey was cut
            short, her spirit lives on in the lives she touched and in the
            mission of this foundation. Through her life, Ogbenyi demonstrated
            the power of love, compassion, and service, and it is through this
            foundation that we continue to honour her memory and keep her legacy
            alive.

          <p>
            The Ogbenyi Mary-Comfort Anastasia Agi Foundation was created to
            keep Ogbenyi’s love and spirit alive. After her passing, her family
            and friends came together to establish this foundation in order to
            continue the work she began and honour her legacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The foundation is committed to empowering individuals, supporting
            community initiatives, and fostering a culture of kindness and
            service—values Ogbenyi demonstrated throughout her life. In addition
            to its charitable efforts, our aim is to raise awareness about
            Ogbenyi’s form of cancer, promote consistent testing, encourage
            preventative measures, and extend support to individuals affected by
            NF1, NF2, MPNT, and similar conditions. Through your support, we
            plan to continue spreading the love and impact she shared with the
            world.
